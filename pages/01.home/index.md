My name is Rachael Dyer. I am a Leicester based private tutor and have been teaching for over 20 years. I tutor GCSE Maths, English, SATS, 11+ and many other subjects. I also  have a lot of experience teaching children with special needs and those struggling within the school environment. Through my years of experience, I know how to get the best out of your child and realise their true potential.

Tutoring is not just about knowledge of a subject. It's also about how to make it engaging and relevant to a child. It's about making study enjoyable and not a chore. It's about looking at the subject from the child's point of view.

I know that I am doing my job right if the child looks forward to my tutor sessions as well as making measurable progress in their chosen subject. The two go hand in hand.

When you hire me you know you are getting a true education professional. One that will make a significant difference in your child's educational journey.
